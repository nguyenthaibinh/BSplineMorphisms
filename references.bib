@article{christensen1996,
	Abstract = {A general automatic approach is presented for accommodating local shape variation when mapping a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) template image into alignment with a topologically similar target image. Local shape variability is accommodated by applying a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate system of the template while constraining the transformation to be smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations. Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the constrained optimization problem. Automatic regridding is performed by propagating templates as the nonlinear transformations evaluated on a finite lattice become singular. Application of the method to intersubject registration of neuroanatomical structures illustrates the ability to account for local anatomical variability.},

@article{shackleford2010,
	Abstract = {Spline-based deformable registration methods are quite popular within the medical-imaging community due to their flexibility and robustness. However, they require a large amount of computing time to obtain adequate results. This paper makes two contributions towards accelerating B-spline-based registration. First, we propose a grid-alignment scheme and associated data structures that greatly reduce the complexity of the registration algorithm. Based on this grid-alignment scheme, we then develop highly data parallel designs for B-spline registration within the stream-processing model, suitable for implementation on multi-core processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Particular attention is focused on an optimal method for performing analytic gradient computations in a data parallel fashion. CPU and GPU versions are validated for execution time and registration quality. Performance results on large images show that our GPU algorithm achieves a speedup of 15 times over the single-threaded CPU implementation whereas our multi-core CPU algorithm achieves a speedup of 8 times over the single-threaded implementation. The CPU and GPU versions achieve near-identical registration quality in terms of RMS differences between the generated vector fields.},

@article{rohlfing2003,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we extend a previously reported intensity-based nonrigid registration algorithm by using a novel regularization term to constrain the deformation. Global motion is modeled by a rigid transformation while local motion is described by a free-form deformation based on B-splines. An information theoretic measure, normalized mutual information, is used as an intensity-based image similarity measure. Registration is performed by searching for the deformation that minimizes a cost function consisting of a weighted combination of the image similarity measure and a regularization term. The novel regularization term is a local volume-preservation (incompressibility) constraint, which is motivated by the assumption that soft tissue is incompressible for small deformations and short time periods. The incompressibility constraint is implemented by penalizing deviations of the Jacobian determinant of the deformation from unity. We apply the nonrigid registration algorithm with and without the incompressibility constraint to precontrast and post-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) breast images from 17 patients. Without using a constraint, the volume of contrast-enhancing lesions decreases by 1%-78% (mean 26%). Image improvement (motion artifact reduction) obtained using the new constraint is compared with that obtained using a smoothness constraint based on the bending energy of the coordinate grid by blinded visual assessment of maximum intensity projections of subtraction images. For both constraints, volume preservation improves, and motion artifact correction worsens, as the weight of the constraint penalty term increases. For a given volume change of the contrast-enhancing lesions (2% of the original volume), the incompressibility constraint reduces motion artifacts better than or equal to the smoothness constraint in 13 out of 17 cases (better in 9, equal in 4, worse in 4). The preliminary results suggest that incorporation of the incompressibility regularization term improves intensity-based free-form nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced MR breast images by greatly reducing the problem of shrinkage of contrast-enhancing structures while simultaneously allowing motion artifacts to be substantially reduced.},

@article{klein2010,
	Abstract = {Medical image registration is an important task in medical image processing. It refers to the process of aligning data sets, possibly from different modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance and computed tomography), different time points (e.g., follow-up scans), and/or different subjects (in case of population studies). A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. The usage of elastix for comparing different registration methods is illustrated with three example experiments, in which individual components of the registration method are varied.},

@article{mattes2003,
	Abstract = {We have implemented and validated an algorithm for three-dimensional positron emission tomography transmission-to-computed tomography registration in the chest, using mutual information as a similarity criterion. Inherent differences in the two imaging protocols produce significant nonrigid motion between the two acquisitions. A rigid body deformation combined with localized cubic B-splines is used to capture this motion. The deformation is defined on a regular grid and is parameterized by potentially several thousand coefficients. Together with a spline-based continuous representation of images and Parzen histogram estimates, our deformation model allows closed-form expressions for the criterion and its gradient. A limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is used in a hierarchical multiresolution framework to automatically align the images. To characterize the performance of the method, 27 scans from patients involved in routine lung cancer staging were used in a validation study. The registrations were assessed visually by two expert observers in specific anatomic locations using a split window validation technique. The visually reported errors are in the 0- to 6-mm range and the average computation time is 100 min on a moderate-performance workstation.},

@article{gee1993,
	Abstract = {To evaluate our system for elastically deforming a three-dimensional atlas to match anatomical brain images, six deformed versions of an atlas were generated. The deformed atlases were created by elastically mapping an anatomical brain atlas onto different MR brain image volumes. The mapping matches the edges of the ventricles and the surface of the brain; the resultant deformations are propagated through the atlas volume, deforming the remainder of the structures in the process. The atlas was then elastically matched to its deformed versions. The accuracy of the resultant matches was evaluated by determining the correspondence of 32 cortical and subcortical structures. The system on average matched the centroid of a structure to within 1 mm of its true position and fit a structure to within 11% of its true volume. The overlap between the matched and true structures, defined by the ratio between the volume of their intersection and the volume of their union, averaged 66%. When the gray-white interface was included for matching, the mean overlap improved to 78%; each structure was matched to within 0.6 mm of its true position and fit to within 6% of its true volume. Preliminary studies were also made to determine the effect of the compliance of the atlas on the resultant match.},

Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},

	Abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

We propose the substitution of a recently developed fast and robust B-spline approximation routine and a modified hierarchical optimization scheme for improved bias field correction over the original N3 algorithm. Similar to the N3 algorithm, we also make the source code, testing, and technical documentation of our contribution, which we denote as "N4ITK," available to the public through the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Performance assessment is demonstrated using simulated data from the publicly available Brainweb database, hyperpolarized (3)He lung image data, and 9.4T postmortem hippocampus data.},

@article{shattuck2008,
	Abstract = {We describe the construction of a digital brain atlas composed of data from manually delineated MRI data. A total of 56 structures were labeled in MRI of 40 healthy, normal volunteers. This labeling was performed according to a set of protocols developed for this project. Pairs of raters were assigned to each structure and trained on the protocol for that structure. Each rater pair was tested for concordance on 6 of the 40 brains; once they had achieved reliability standards, they divided the task of delineating the remaining 34 brains. The data were then spatially normalized to well-known templates using 3 popular algorithms: AIR5.2.5's nonlinear warp (Woods et al., 1998) paired with the ICBM452 Warp 5 atlas (Rex et al., 2003), FSL's FLIRT (Smith et al., 2004) was paired with its own template, a skull-stripped version of the ICBM152 T1 average; and SPM5's unified segmentation method (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) was paired with its canonical brain, the whole head ICBM152 T1 average. We thus produced 3 variants of our atlas, where each was constructed from 40 representative samples of a data processing stream that one might use for analysis. For each normalization algorithm, the individual structure delineations were then resampled according to the computed transformations. We next computed averages at each voxel location to estimate the probability of that voxel belonging to each of the 56 structures. Each version of the atlas contains, for every voxel, probability densities for each region, thus providing a resource for automated probabilistic labeling of external data types registered into standard spaces; we also computed average intensity images and tissue density maps based on the three methods and target spaces. These atlases will serve as a resource for diverse applications including meta-analysis of functional and structural imaging data and other bioinformatics applications where display of arbitrary labels in probabilistically defined anatomic space will facilitate both knowledge-based development and visualization of findings from multiple disciplines.},

@article{klein2009,
	Abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.},

In contrast to existing non-rigid registration methods based on FFDs the proposed diffeomorphic non-rigid registration algorithm based on free-form deformations (FFDs) which are modelled by B-splines. To construct a diffeomorphic transformation we compose a sequence of free-form deformations while ensuring that individual FFDs are one-to-one transformations. We have evaluated the algorithm on 20 normal brain MR images which have been manually segmented into 67 anatomical structures. Using the agreement between manual segmentation and segmentation propagation as a measure of registration quality we have compared the algorithm to an existing FFD registration algorithm and a modified FFD registration algorithm which penalises non-diffeomorphic transformations. The results show that the proposed algorithm generates diffeomorphic transformations while providing similar levels of performance as the existing FFD registration algorithm in terms of registration accuracy.},

	Abstract = {We present an automatic subpixel registration algorithm that minimizes the mean square intensity difference between a reference and a test data set, which can be either images (two-dimensional) or volumes (three-dimensional). It uses an explicit spline representation of the images in conjunction with spline processing, and is based on a coarse-to-fine iterative strategy (pyramid approach). The minimization is performed according to a new variation (ML*) of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear least-square optimization. The geometric deformation model is a global three-dimensional (3-D) affine transformation that can be optionally restricted to rigid-body motion (rotation and translation), combined with isometric scaling. It also includes an optional adjustment of image contrast differences. We obtain excellent results for the registration of intramodality positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We conclude that the multiresolution refinement strategy is more robust than a comparable single-stage method, being less likely to be trapped into a false local optimum. In addition, our improved version of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm is faster.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast MRI. A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Nonrigid image registration is an important task for many medical imaging applications. In particular, for radiation oncology it is desirable to track respiratory motion for thoracic cancer treatment. B-splines are convenient for modeling nonrigid deformations, but ensuring invertibility can be a challenge. This paper describes sufficient conditions for local invertibility of deformations based on B-spline bases. These sufficient conditions can be used with constrained optimization to enforce local invertibility. We also incorporate these conditions into nonrigid image registration methods based on a simple penalty approach that encourages diffeomorphic deformations. Traditional Jacobian penalty methods penalize negative Jacobian determinant values only at grid points. In contrast, our new method enforces a sufficient condition for invertibility directly on the deformation coefficients to encourage invertibility globally over a 3D continuous domain. The proposed penalty approach requires substantially less compute time than Jacobian penalties per iteration.},

@article{de-craene2011,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new registration algorithm, called Temporal Diffeomorphic Free Form Deformation (TDFFD), and its application to motion and strain quantification from a sequence of 3D ultrasound (US) images. The originality of our approach resides in enforcing time consistency by representing the 4D velocity field as the sum of continuous spatiotemporal B-Spline kernels. The spatiotemporal displacement field is then recovered through forward Eulerian integration of the non-stationary velocity field. The strain tensor is computed locally using the spatial derivatives of the reconstructed displacement field. The energy functional considered in this paper weighs two terms: the image similarity and a regularization term. The image similarity metric is the sum of squared differences between the intensities of each frame and a reference one. Any frame in the sequence can be chosen as reference. The regularization term is based on the incompressibility of myocardial tissue. TDFFD was compared to pairwise 3D FFD and 3D+t FFD, both on displacement and velocity fields, on a set of synthetic 3D US images with different noise levels. TDFFD showed increased robustness to noise compared to these two state-of-the-art algorithms. TDFFD also proved to be more resistant to a reduced temporal resolution when decimating this synthetic sequence. Finally, this synthetic dataset was used to determine optimal settings of the TDFFD algorithm. Subsequently, TDFFD was applied to a database of cardiac 3D US images of the left ventricle acquired from 9 healthy volunteers and 13 patients treated by Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). On healthy cases, uniform strain patterns were observed over all myocardial segments, as physiologically expected. On all CRT patients, the improvement in synchrony of regional longitudinal strain correlated with CRT clinical outcome as quantified by the reduction of end-systolic left ventricular volume at follow-up (6 and 12months), showing the potential of the proposed algorithm for the assessment of CRT.},

@article{tustison2009,
	Abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically, these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline object describes the transformation of the image registration solution. Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution. The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation experimentation.},
